h1. Uki Reader

Just a spike playing around with "Uki":http://github.com/voloko/uki, based on the "Uki Mail.app":http://github.com/voloko/uki_mail_app demo. The goal is to build something like "Helvetireader":http://helvetireader.com but based on Uki. If you want join me playing just give me a ping. I'll add you as a collaborator.

h2. Installation

Add "this script":http://github.com/svenfuchs/uki_reader/blob/master/hook.js as a Firefox "Greasemonkey":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 script for http://www.google.com/reader/*

It should be easy to do a Google Chrome extension but I haven't tried, yet.

h2. Usage

Go to "http://www.google.com/reader":http://www.google.com/reader. You need to log in if you aren't.

You should see Google Reader loading. It might take a second for the Greasemonkey hook to load the Uki Reader script from Github. 

As soon as it kicks in you should see something like this:

h2. Status

So far it only does very basic reading. I.e. it loads your feeds from the Google Reader API and displays them in the left feeds pane. When you click on a feed it will load the posts and list them in the right/top posts table. It also can display posts in the right/bottom post details pane.

It can't properly display unread counts or even post status information back to Google.
